# Liftgate
Game server management, orchestration, and coordination platform.

## Project Status
**This project is a W.I.P.** This README will be updated once we enter a more stable state.

## Platform Compatability 
The liftgate server project is only built to support Unix-based operating systems. More specifically, the project has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

The liftgate server also only works on single-server systems. Compatibility for multiserver systems may come in the future.

### TODO
- [ ] Add full support for scaling with multiple datacenters
