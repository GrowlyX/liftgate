# Liftgate
Game server management, orchestration, and scaling platform.

## Project Status
**This project is a W.I.P.** This README will be updated once we enter a more stable state.

## Notice
Docker & k8s (if a valid option) should be used instead of this. This project is only for those who do not have the experience or time to configure a full setup for other platforms.

## Platform Compatability 
The liftgate server project is only built to support Unix-based operating systems. The project has also only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

The liftgate server also only works on single-server systems. Compatibility for multiserver systems may come in the future.

### TODO
- [ ] Add full support for scaling with multiple datacenters
- [ ] Use hoplite for parsing/saving configuration files on the server and other platforms
